Hi, Iâ€™m Krishna ðŸ‘‹ â€” an engineer passionate about learning and building solutions that scale.

Iâ€™ve always loved problem-solving and figuring out how things work. What excites me most is seeing how different components come together to create something greater than the sum of their parts.

My journey started in mechanical and aerospace engineering. I earned my bachelorâ€™s in Structural Engineering with a focus in Aerospace Structures from UC San Diego in 2019. After graduation, I joined Boeing as a Structural Analyst, where I worked on damage assessments to keep in-service aircraft safe and reliable. During my time there, I developed three analysis procedures that were adopted company-wide, reducing response times by 20%.

As a lifelong learner, I pursued a masterâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering at USC, but soon realized my passion lay in software and scalable technologies. In 2021, I transitioned into a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, combining my engineering foundation with computer science to solve problems with greater reach. At the same time, I joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), contributing to nuclear fusion energy researchâ€”work that has the potential to transform our future.

Today, I continue to grow at the intersection of engineering and computer science, motivated by tackling big challenges and creating meaningful impact.
